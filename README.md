This project was for a Machine Learning course for university.

It includes multiple algorithms such as Linear Regression, Neural Networks, Decision Trees...

It also includes K-Fold Cross-Validation for all the algorithms.

- `helper.py` contains the code for all the **algorithms** and **CV**.
- `pcode.py` is used to load the functions and call them.
